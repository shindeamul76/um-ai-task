<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
2. Create a .env file and add the following variables
   ```sh
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/um_ai
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://um-ai-db_owner:BaRHsEA53mVu@ep-black-frog-a1d0y3uc.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/um-ai-db?sslmode=require"
   DATABASE_NAME=um-ai-db
   DATABASE_USER=
   DTABASE_PASSWORD=
   DATABASE_HOST=
   DATABASE_PORT=5432
   REDIS_HOST= ''
   REDIS_PORT= 17632
   REDIS_PASSWORD= ''
   ```
3. Run the server
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver   
   ```

## Features
1. I have used the jwt token for authentication focused on the user onboarding process and and giving responses to the user using the open ai api.
2. I have used the redis for caching the user's questionnaire answers.
3. I have also Keeping the cnversion history in the redis to keep track of the conversation history.

# Note: -  Calling the message send and receive api will take some time to respond as it is calling the open ai api and the conversation history is being stored in the redis cache and the questionnaire answers are being cached in the redis so it will take around 4-5 seconds to respond.

# Note: - I have also attached the postman collection for the api calls in the postman folder.
